"DELAWARE'S DIVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES APPROVED FOR PANDEMIC EBT      TO FEED CHILDREN DURING COVID-19 EMERGENCY     ","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","May 5, 2020","NEW CASTLE (May 5, 2020) - On May 1, the Division of Social Services was approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to operate Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT), a new program authorized by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act that provides assistance to families with children who are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals.       The P-EBT program provides a supplemental food-purchasing benefit to current Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households and a new EBT benefit to other eligible households to offset the cost of meals that would have otherwise been available at school.      Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, states may submit a plan to the Secretary of Agriculture for providing P-EBT benefits to SNAP and non-SNAP households with children who have temporarily lost access to free or reduced-price school meals due to pandemic-related school closures. State agencies may operate P-EBT when a school is closed for at least five consecutive days during a public health emergency designation during which the school would otherwise be in session.      Gov. John Carney declared a State of Emergency on March 13, all Delaware schools were closed as of March 16, and Gov. Carney announced April 24 that schools would remain closed through the end of the school year. This closure will result in an average total of 65 canceled school days.      For the 2019-2020 school year, Delaware has approximately 100,000 children eligible for free or reduced-priced school meals who are now eligible to receive P-EBT benefits. The P-EBT benefits will be issued as a supplement to SNAP households on their existing EBT cards and to non-SNAP households on a new EBT card along with details on how to use the card. Households that are not receiving SNAP will automatically receive one P-EBT card in the mail for all eligible children in their household.      ""The Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer program is an important way for the Department of Health and Social Services to ensure that children will get the nutrition they need, especially with schools closed for the remainder of the school year,"" said DHSS Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. ""We are grateful for the approval of Delaware's program by the USDA.""          Delaware will follow the P-EBT benefit guidance provided by the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service. The P-EBT benefit amount is equal to the federal reimbursement rate for breakfast and lunch at the rate of $5.70 per child, per canceled school day. Eligible households will receive P-EBT benefits as follows:                                     P-EBT Issuance Month                             SNAP Households                             Non-SNAP Households                             March & April 2020               Amount: $193.80 per child      Issuance Date: no later than      May 11                    Amount: $193.80 per child     Issuance Date: mid-May                         May 2020               Amount: $119.70 per child               Amount: $119.70 per child                         June 2020               Amount: $57.00 per child               Amount: $57.00 per child                                         The implementation of P-EBT in Delaware helps to keep families healthy and children fed during this national emergency. Households will receive written notification regarding P-EBT benefits.

"DHSS SEEKS COMMENT ON STATE PLAN ON AGING      AT TWO PUBLIC HEARINGS THIS MONTH     ","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","April 17, 2020","NEW CASTLE (April 17, 2020) - The Delaware Department of Health and Social Services' Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities will seek public comment on its proposed State Plan on Aging for the period of October 2020 through September 2024.          The state plan has been developed to meet requirements under Title III and Title VII of the Older Americans Act. The act provides funding for a variety of programs and services for older     Delawareans and their caregivers, including supportive services, nutrition programs, disease prevention and health promotion initiatives, elder rights protection activities and caregiver support programs.          The state hearings, to be held virtually due to COVID-19 public gathering restrictions, will provide an opportunity for the public to offer comments and suggestions on the plan. The schedule is:                         April 20, 2020, 1-3 p.m.     Virtual Meeting Information: https://zoom.us/j/570333700      By phone: 1 (646) 876-9923.

Today, nearly one in four Delawareans is age 60 or older. By the year 2040, Delawareans who are age 60 and older will make up one-third of the state's population, or more than 313,835 people. That same year, state's population of people age 85 and older is projected to have grown by 171.6% since 2015.          ""Public input is essential to the development of Delaware's State Plan on Aging, to ensure that our programs, supports and services reflect the growing and changing needs of Delaware's older adult population,"" said DHSS Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician.  ""We know that you want to age well; have access to information, supports and person-centered services that respond to your individual needs; and continue to thrive in your homes and communities. We are asking you to partner with us in shaping what that will look like over the next four years.""               The Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities will use the strategies in the State Plan on Aging to address the growing and changing needs of older Delawareans and persons with disabilities.          The 2020-2024 State Plan on Aging focuses on initiatives such as:           Developing and implementing best practices in person-centered case management and coordination of services and supports.      Collaborating with community partners to identify barriers, improve access, and facilitate coordination of cognitive health resources and services for persons with cognitive health needs.      Leading the effort to become a dementia-friendly state, ensuring that communities throughout Delaware are equipped to support persons living with dementia and their caregivers.      Promoting the development, expansion, and capacity of comprehensive and coordinated programs that serve and support caregivers.     Developing a collaborative approach with other agencies, inclusive of a multi-disciplinary team, to strengthen the abuse, neglect and exploitation response across the Delaware aging network.     Improving delivery of participant-directed services, empowering participants to make choices about service delivery.

The most recent deaths involve a 33-year-old female resident of a long-term care facility in Sussex County who had underlying health conditions and an 88-year-old female resident of a long-term care facility in Sussex County who had underlying health conditions. Individuals who have died from COVID-19 ranged in age from 33 to 96 years.

"ADDITIONAL ALTERNATE CARE SITE","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","April 7, 2020","Smyrna - The Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) and the State Health Operations Center (SHOC) are announcing today the plan for an additional alternate care site (ACS) to support Kent and Sussex Counties.  This plan is to accommodate overflow patients from Delaware hospital systems as they begin to experience a surge in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  This mobile hospital will join the two previously designated: the first on the campus of Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children and the second at Governor Bacon Health Center.     The site will be a collaborative effort between Bayhealth, Nanticoke Memorial Hospital, and Beebe Healthcare.  The three healthcare systems are coordinating their surge plans with county and state officials.  The primary goal is to maintain the surge within current hospitals.  If needed, the state has offered to set up a mobile hospital as an alternate care site.  Triggers have been identified as well as potential locations dependent on surge.  Site evaluations were performed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Delaware National Guard in the weeks preceding.  The Delaware National Guard will provide crucial assistance with preparing, building, and operating this facility.  The field hospital was utilized during a 2016 exercise and the Delaware National Guard stands ready to deploy the unit as previously trained.  The mobile hospital can potentially treat 50-60 patients who do not have COVID-19.  If the site is used for COVID-19 patients that number would be reduced.  Numerous buildings were surveyed, however proximity to existing health care facilities and the accompanying resources are crucial to a successful mission          The hospitals are managing the patients now with their current staffing but we are preparing for the expected increase in the coming days.  This location, like the New Castle County sites, will be opened to alleviate the surge on hospitals when needed.  We are grateful for the efforts of our partners in the health care systems within the state, the Division of Public Health, and the Delaware National Guard for their continued support.

DPH epidemiologists are transitioning to a new data reporting system. During the transition period, not all fields (sex) have complete information, and some categories of data (critically ill, Delawareans recovered) are reflective of statistics as of April 5, 2020.        Delaware is considering patients fully recovered seven days after the resolution of their symptoms. Three days after symptoms resolve, patients are no longer required to self-isolate at home; however, they must continue to practice strict social distancing for the remaining four days before returning to their normal daily routine.To protect personal health information, DPH will not disclose additional information about the individuals who passed away, nor will DPH confirm specific information about any individual case,even if other persons or entities disclose it independently.Today DPH began a new collaboration with the United Way of Delaware to triage incoming calls related to COVID-19.  Anyone with a question about COVID-19, whether related to medical or social service needs, should call Delaware 2-1-1, 1-800-560-3372, 7-1-1 for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, or text your ZIP code to 898-211. In addition, the Division of Public Health asks any Delaware health care, long-term care, residential, or other high-risk facility with questions or concerns to email:DPH_PAC@delaware.gov or call the DPH Call Center at 1-866-408-1899 and press ext. 2.        Widespread community transmission is occurring throughout the state,which means COVID-19 is actively circulating in the community.If you are sick with any of the following symptoms,stay home:fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat,muscle fatigue,or digestive symptoms such as vomiting,diarrhea, abdominal pain or lack of appetite.If you are sick and need essential supplies, ask someone else to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy to get what you need. If you think you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, or have symptoms of illness, make sure to distance yourself from others, particularly vulnerable populations. Older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions - including serious heart conditions, chronic lung conditions, including moderate to severe asthma, severe obesity and those who are immunocompromised, including through cancer treatment - might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.        Statewide testing at standing health facility testing sites require a physician's order or prescription to be tested (*Bayhealth patients will be pre-screened via phone without needing to see a provider first). These are not walk-in testing sites. Those without a primary care provider can call the DPH Call Center Line at 1-866-408-1899.

"ALTERNATE CARE SITES","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","April 6, 2020","SMYRNA (April 6, 2020)  - The Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) and the State Health Operations Center (SHOC) are announcing today the designation of alternative care sites (ACS) in New Castle County to accommodate overflow patients from Delaware hospital systems as they begin to experience a surge in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Sites for the southern part of the state are expected to be announced later this week.           One alternate care site will be Governor Bacon Health Center, the Department of Health and Social Services' long-term care facility in Delaware City, said DEMA Director A.J. Schall and Public Health Director Dr. Karyl Rattay.            Residents in two units will be transferred over several days this week - along with their current staff - to the Delaware Hospital for the Chronically Ill, another DHSS long-term facility in Smyrna. The residents from Governor Bacon will be placed in a separate unit at the DHCI Campus, isolated from current residents of DHCI. If all transferred residents clear the 14-day quarantine period, they will be integrated with the current residents of DHCI, said DHSS Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician.            Residents of one unit at Governor Bacon will remain on the second floor for 14 days, with the current staff caring for them. If those residents clear the quarantine period, they also will be transferred to Delaware Hospital for the Chronically Ill.                The residents' families and Governor Bacon staff have been notified of Governor Bacon's alternate care site designation and the impending move, Secretary Walker said. As floors of Governor Bacon are made available, they will be deep-cleaned by DHSS before they are used as an alternative care site, Secretary Walker said. When all residents are moved to Delaware Hospital for the Chronically Ill, Dr. Rattay said the State will have the potential of 75 additional beds at Governor Bacon for overflow patients from Delaware's hospitals. Staffing to care for the potential overflow patients is currently being developed.                 ""We are grateful to the families of the residents and the staff for understanding why we have to move the residents of Governor Bacon,"" Secretary Walker said. ""Throughout this crisis, our top priority is the health and safety of our residents and also making sure that our staff who care for our residents are safe and healthy as well.""     Schall and Dr. Rattay said the other alternate care site being announced today by DEMA and SHOC is within Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children. Nemours will only be accepting transfers from Delaware community hospitals of non-COVID-19 adults.                  Nemours duPont Hospital for Children has developed two treatment areas to provide medical care for non-COVID-19 adults. The rehabilitation gym, which is located one floor below the main level and away from pediatric care, has been converted into an alternative care site for low-acuity cases beginning with 38 beds, with possible expansion if needed. A medical intensive care unit will be situated across and separate from the pediatric intensive care unit, and be comprised of 24 beds.             Nemours's treatment sites can become operational this week, and will begin providing medical care only once capacity is exceeded within Delaware's community hospitals. Nemours' surge sites will remain operational until community hospitals can reabsorb these non-COVID-19 adult patients.           Schall and Dr. Rattay said last week the State worked with Nemours, St. Francis Healthcare and ChristianaCare to identify options for the northern part of the state. After searching multiple possible sites with the Army Corp of Engineers, the Nemours campus was identified as the location that would provide the most efficiencies.                   Nemours has worked diligently over the last week to prep part of its building and this week training will take place with Nemours, ChristianeCare and the Delaware National Guard.                 Schall and Dr. Rattay said the State, National Guard and Army Corp of Engineers continue to work with Beebe Healthcare, Nanticoke Health Services and Bayhealth for options to place non-COVID-19 patients from the southern hospitals if surge occurs. Site assessments continue today, with potential options being the old Milford Memorial Hospital and a National Guard field option adjacent to one of the current hospitals.

Six residents of a memory care unit of HarborChase of Wilmington have tested positive for COVID-19, including five who are now hospitalized, according to the Division of Public Health. The current census of that unit is 36. DHSS staff have worked with the assisted-living facility to ensure resident and staff safety. The source of the infection is under investigation.               ""Responding to multiple cases of COVID-19 in such facilities is among our greatest concerns,"" said DHSS Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. ""The populations who live in these facilities are at the highest risk for COVID-19, based on their age and underlying health conditions. Our DHSS team is working closely with the facility's staff to make sure that the residents with COVID-19 are isolated from other residents, and that staff follow strict safety protocols regarding care of the individuals with the virus and also screening of all who enter the facility.""               HarborChase is the second care facility in Delaware to have an outbreak of coronavirus cases. On Thursday, DHSS announced the coronavirus-related death of an 86-year-old male resident of Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in Newark and that six additional residents had tested positive for COVID-19. A seventh resident has since tested positive.               On March 13, 2020, the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued aggressive measures for nursing homes nationwide to follow with respect to safety at their facilities:               Restricting all visitors, effective immediately, with exceptions for compassionate care, such as end-of-life situations;     Restricting all volunteers and nonessential health care personnel and other personnel (i.e. barbers);     Canceling all group activities and communal dining;     Implementing active screening of residents and health care personnel for fever and respiratory systems.     In cases of compassionate care, CMS advises that visitors will be equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, and the visits will be limited to a specific room.               On March 16, DHSS issued  further restrictive and specific guidance to all facilities serving older adults, including screening protocols for visitors, requirements for disinfecting rooms, and reinforcing resident and staff hygiene.               Secretary Walker said as difficult as it is for loved ones not to visit residents of long-term care facilities during the coronavirus crisis, those visitor restrictions are in place to help keep vulnerable residents safe. DHSS' Division of Health Care Quality (DHCQ) is continuing to work closely with long-term care facilities in the state to verify that such strong measures are in place at each facility, and if not, to assist them in implementing stronger protocols.

"     COVID-19 UPDATE FOR MARCH 24, 2020:       DPH ANNOUNCES SEVENTEEN ADDITIONAL POSITIVE CASES      ","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","March 24, 2020","SMYRNA (March 24, 2020) - The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is providing an update on the number of positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported in the state.             There have been 104 total laboratory-confirmed cases in the state since March 11. This includes 17 additional cases since Monday. Of the Delawareans diagnosed with COVID-19, 71 are from New Castle County, 10 are from Kent County, and 23 are from Sussex County.             Of the 104 cases, 51 are male and 53 are female. The individuals range in age from 1 to 90. Eleven individuals are currently hospitalized; five are critically ill. The source of exposure for many of these positive cases is unknown, which indicates community spread of the virus is occurring in the state.            To protect personal health information, DPH will not disclose additional information about the individuals. DPH cannot confirm specific information even if other entities choose to make their own announcements.            Monday, Governor John Carney declared a Public Health Emergency in Delaware. The declaration strengthened Delaware's health care workforce by enabling those medical professionals with out-of-state licenses, or who are retired but in good standing, to support Delaware's health care workforce needs.  On Sunday, March 22, Governor Carney issued the fourth and fifth modifications to his State of Emergency declaration, ordering Delawareans to stay at home whenever possible and closing all non-essential businesses in the state to help stop community spread of COVID-19. The orders went into effect at 8:00 a.m. today.               If you think you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, or have symptoms of illness, make sure to distance yourself from others, particularly vulnerable populations. This includes people 60 years of age and older; people with serious chronic health conditions such as diabetes, lung disease, heart disease; or those who are immunocompromised.             For individuals who are sick, stay home and contact your primary care provider for guidance regarding symptoms and next steps.            ""While the hallmark symptoms associated with COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath, we are noticing initial symptoms of those who test positive for the virus often include body aches and sore throat. The Division of Public Health recommends individuals stay home if these symptoms are present,"" said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. ""This underscores the evolving aspects of this situation and how individuals react differently to the virus. The bottom line is that even if you do not have the prominent symptoms described for this virus, it is vitally important that you stay home and self-isolate if you are sick to prevent spread of illness to others.""            Statewide testing at standing health facility testing sites began on Monday, March 23. These are not walk-in testing sites. A physician's order or prescription is required for testing at one of the standing test sites (*Bayhealth patients will be pre-screened via phone without needing to see a provider first). Those without a primary care provider can call the DPH Call Center Line at 1-888-408-1899. Individuals awaiting test results, should wait to hear back from their medical provider.

"DPH ANNOUNCES ADDITIONAL POSITIVE CASES OF CORONAVIRUS ","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","March 17, 2020","DOVER (March 17, 2020)  -  The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is announcing eight additional positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) bringing the statewide total to 16.  Seven of the eight individuals are New Castle County residents, and one is the first reported case in Sussex County.  Four of these individuals are males, and four are females.  All but one is self-isolating at home; one in New Castle County is hospitalized. Six of the seven New Castle County residents participated in the ChristianaCare Health System drive through testing event.  The Sussex County resident had a travel-related exposure. The source of the exposure of the remaining individuals is under investigation.  DPH will not be disclosing additional information about the individuals. DPH does not have the results for all of the patients who attended drive-through event; the hospital system that performed the testing will report results to the patients, and all positive results to DPH.    DPH's guidance for individuals who are well, are to limit social contacts while practicing social distancing from others (keeping six feet apart), and finding alternative ways to greet people that don't involve shaking hands, as well as practicing good hand and cough hygiene. However, individuals who are at elevated risk, which includes persons age 60 and older and those with chronic underlying health conditions, are urged to remain at home to limit their exposure to germs.        For individuals who are sick, particularly with fever, cough and shortness of breath, stay home, and contact your primary care provider for guidance regarding symptoms and next steps.      Testing for coronavirus disease is not recommended for individuals who do not have any symptoms of illness. For individuals who have symptoms of illness (fever and cough, or shortness of breath), specimens will be collected by medical providers and run at either a commercial laboratory or the Public Health Lab.  Medical providers must collect specimens for testing; specimens are not collected at the DPH Lab or at commercial labs. Medical providers should evaluate patients and rule out other causes of illness first before recommending testing for COVID-19.       While testing for the disease at the Public Health Lab requires DPH approval, providers do not need DPH approval to submit test samples to commercial labs. With commercial lab testing now available, Delaware has enough capacity to accommodate its current testing needs. Providers only need to collect nasal swabs as they would for flu to submit samples for testing.     There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19 infection at this time. While in some cases illnesses can be severe and require hospitalization, many individuals infected with COVID-19 recover by resting, drinking plenty of liquids and taking pain, and fever-reducing medications.     DPH reminds Delawareans to use everyday measures to prevent the spread of all infections, which would also slow the spread of COVID-19:<U+202F>     Cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. If you use a tissue, dispose of it right away.  Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, including the backs of your hands and under your nails, for 20 seconds. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Do not touch your face, eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.  Clean commonly used surfaces such as computers, desktops, countertops cabinets, handles and more with disinfectant.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

The case involves a New Castle County woman under the age of 30. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is no longer requiring presumptive positive results to go through CDC for confirmatory testing, and that all presumptive positives up to this date are considered confirmed.     The individual is not severely ill and is currently self-isolated at home. The individual is connected to the University of Delaware community.  The source of her exposure is still under investigation. Epidemiologists from the Division of Public Health are working to identify any close contacts of the individuals who were possibly exposed. If other people are found to have possibly been exposed, state health officials will provide guidance to these individuals and monitor them closely for the development of symptoms. DPH will not be disclosing additional information about the individual.           ""Because of the nature of this disease, we know that we are going to continue to see an increased number of cases in Delaware. This announcement brings Delaware's total positive cases to seven,"" said Dr. Karyl Rattay. ""With the amount of test samples that health care systems and providers across the state are submitting to the Delaware Public Health Lab and to commercial labs, the numbers of patients being tested have increased significantly.

"DELAWARE ISSUES GUIDANCE FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ON CORONAVIRUS","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","March 14, 2020","SMYRNA (March 14, 2020) - The State of Delaware issued guidance today to assist  non-public school child care facilities with their response to the global outbreak of respiratory coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).            Based on advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Delaware Division of Public Health does not recommend closing non-public school child care settings at this time. The data available from 74,000 cases that occurred in China, show that only 2 percent of individuals under 19 years of age tested positive for COVID-19.           ""Children appear to be less vulnerable to this virus and based upon the science we have now, it does not indicate that closing child care facilities will help in reducing the spread of COVID-19,"" said Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. ""Child care centers are controlled environments generally with small classroom sizes. Providers know who is coming in and out, who is sick, and are able to restrict access to help reduce risk. We are constantly evaluating information, but right now, parents should continue sending their children to child care to help provide structure.""           Suggested preventive measures that child care facilities should include:      Increase handwashing procedures throughout the day for staff and children using soap and water and scrubbing vigorously for at least 20 seconds.     Remind adults and children to avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.     Strictly enforce the child care facility's illness policy for both children and staff.     Separate sick students and adults from others until they can go home.     Rigorously implement cleaning for toys and surfaces.     Remove and sanitize mouthed toys immediately.     Regularly launder soft items such as washable plush toys, bedding, and clothing.            More information on guidance for child care facilities is available online at the CDC website.           ""While families can typically make do for a day or two when schools are closed, longer closures make it harder to find child care,"" said Ray Fitzgerald, Director of DHSS' Division of Social Services. ""We know parents are concerned about their employment and keeping non-public school child care open helps to reduce that worry.""

Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated space, as much as possible.     When you go out in public, including to doctor appointments or dialysis, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often.     Take everyday precaution to keep space between yourself and others.     If an outbreak does occur, stay home as much as possible.     Stock up on supplies, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, food and water, and other household items.     Have a plan in the event you get sick, including discussing with household members, other relatives, and friends what you might need.

"DHSS RECOMMENDS NURSING HOMES AND OTHER LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES TEMPORARILY BAN VISITORS TO REDUCE CORONAVIRUS RISK  ","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","March 12, 2020","NEW CASTLE (March 12, 2020)  - The Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) is recommending that all Delaware nursing homes, long-term care facilities and adult day-care centers temporarily end visitation as a way to reduce the risk of residents and clients contracting coronavirus disease (COVID-19).     The recommendation follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance that urges long-term care facilities to be vigilant in preventing the introduction and spread of COVID-19. DHSS' Division of Public Health and DEMA are working with DHSS' Division of Health Care Quality (DHCQ), Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities (DSAAPD) and other community partners to implement strategies and restrictions to keep residents safe and healthy. In addition to restricting visitors, DHSS is urging Delaware's long-term care facilities to:               Make online methods of face-to face communication and phone calls available.     Staff should be monitored if they are showing any signs of respiratory infection such as fever, cough or sore throat.     Any staff member who has these signs or symptoms should not go to work. Any staff that develop these signs or symptoms on the job should immediately stop working, put on a face mask, and self-isolate at home.     Nursing homes should increase availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, tissues, no-touch receptacles for disposal, and face masks at entrances, waiting rooms, and resident check-ins.     Signage should be increased for vigilant infection prevention.     Properly clean, disinfect, and limit sharing of medical equipment between residents and areas of the facility.                     The CDC has found that early data suggests older people are twice as likely to suffer a serious illness from coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19. Earlier this week, DHSS urged older Delawareans and people with severe chronic health conditions to follow CDC guidance that they ""avoid crowds as much as possible"" as a way to reduce their risk. Delaware announced its first presumed positive cases this week and the Division of Public Health (DPH) and other state partners are planning for the likelihood of community transmission.           The Department of Health and Social Services advises that community preparedness planning - recommended by CDC - should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration. Many of these individuals live in the community, and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in the community to maintain their independence and their health. For family members and caregivers providing support, the CDC recommends these steps:               Know what medications your loved one is taking and see if you can help them have extra on hand.     Monitor food and other medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care) needed and create a back-up plan.     Stock up on non-perishable food items to have on hand in your home to minimize trips to stores.     If you care for a loved one living in a care facility, monitor the situation, ask about the health of the other residents frequently and know the protocol if there is an outbreak.          DPH continues to monitor travelers arriving in the U.S. from countries with a Level 2 or higher Travel Alert. The CDC recommended that such travelers be monitored for 14 days after their return. During the 14-day period, these persons are asked to remain at home while self-monitoring for symptoms. If any of these persons shows symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, the person should call DPH at 1-866-408-1899 immediately to determine next steps, which may include transport to a local hospital for evaluation and testing.

These individuals may not use public transportation to get home. They will need to remain home for at least 14 days after last contact with positive cases.      Individuals who did not have contact with these individuals can return home and go about their daily lives. They should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 and contact their primary contact provider if symptoms appear.

"DIVISION OF PUBLIC HEALTH URGES AT-RISK POPULATIONS TO FOLLOW CDC GUIDANCE ON CORONAVIRUS DISEASE ","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","March 9, 2020","NEW CASTLE (March 9, 2020)  - The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) advises older Delawareans and people with severe chronic health conditions to follow guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encouraging them to ""avoid crowds as much as possible"" as a way to reduce their risk of contracting coronavirus disease.     The CDC has found that early data suggests older people are twice as likely to suffer a serious illness from coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19. Delaware has no confirmed cases, but DPH and other state partners are planning for the likelihood of community transmission. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recommended on Sunday that those at greatest risk - older Americans and those with severe chronic health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes - should abstain from travel.     If you are in the higher-risk groups for getting very sick from COVID-19, the CDC recommends you should:     Avoid non-essential travel such as long plane trips and defer all cruise trips worldwide. Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated space, as much as possible. When you go out in public, including to doctor appointments or dialysis, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often. Take everyday precaution to keep space between yourself and others.      If an outbreak does occur, stay home as much as possible. Stock up on supplies, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, food and water, and other household items. Have a plan in the event you get sick, including discussing with household members, other relatives, and friends to discuss what you might need. ""Because Delaware has a high percentage of older residents and people with severe underlying health conditions, we urge them and their families to follow the CDC's recommendation to avoid crowds as much as possible,"" said Department of Health of Social Services (DHSS) Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. ""While we are grateful that we don't have any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our state, we are planning for community transmission of the disease. We urge Delawareans to take these important steps to reduce their exposure to the virus and to prepare when community transmission does happen here."" Older Delawareans, people with severe chronic health conditions and all other members of the public can call the Division of Public Health's Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899 or TTY at 1-800-232-5460 from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Or email DPHCall@delaware.gov. For the latest on Delaware's response, go to de.gov/coronavirus . ""Our efforts, where before they were focused on containment of the disease, are now focused on mitigating the impact of it when it does occur,"" said Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Division of Public Health. Delaware has no confirmed cases of COVID-19. As of March 9, 15 people have been tested in Delaware; all have been negative. In addition, testing and results are pending for three individuals, two in New Castle County, and one in Kent County. DPH is currently monitoring 18 returning travelers.     The CDC also urges long-term care facilities to be vigilant in preventing the introduction and spread of COVID-19. The Division of Public Health and DEMA are working with DHSS' Division of Health Care Quality (DHCQ), Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities (DSAAPD) and other community partners to implement strategies and restrictions to keep residents safe and healthy. Finally, DPH advises that community preparedness planning - recommended by CDC - should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration. Many of these individuals live in the community, and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in the community to maintain their independence and their health. For family members and caregivers providing support, the CDC recommends these steps:          Know what medications your loved one is taking and see if you can help them have extra on hand.     Monitor food and other medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care) needed and create a back-up plan.Stock up on non-perishable food items to have on hand in your home to minimize trips to stores.     If you care for a loved one living in a care facility, monitor the situation, ask about the health of the other residents frequently and know the protocol if there is an outbreak.     DPH continues to monitor travelers arriving in the U.S. from countries with a Level 2 or higher Travel Alert (China, Italy, Japan, Iran or South Korea). The CDC recommended that such travelers be monitored for 14 days after their return. During the 14-day period, these persons are asked to remain at home while self-monitoring for symptoms. If any of these persons shows symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, the person should call DPH at 1-866-408-1899 immediately to determine next steps, which may include transport to a local hospital for evaluation and testing.     As of March 9, there are more than 111,000 cases of coronavirus disease worldwide, including more than 3,800 deaths. In the United States, there are more than 600 cases and 22 deaths to date. Consistent with the CDC's guidance, Dr. Rattay said community spread is likely to continue increasing across the country.             CDC officials also have said it is important for families and communities to prepare for what they would do if community spread occurs by recommending:               Schools review their infection prevention and control plans in the event there is a local outbreak.Employers review their contingency plans to ensure they are able to operate with adaptations and respond if an employee gets sick.Individuals and families understand steps they can take to help slow the spread of illness, including avoiding travel to hard-hit areas and staying home when sick. DPH has a strong relationship with hospitals, EMS, and first responder agencies through its partnership with the state's Department of Safety and Homeland Security (DSHS).      Staff have been holding regular calls with hospitals, medical providers, school superintendents, the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), DSHS and EMS agencies. Delaware is experiencing a particularly serious flu season with 6,000 lab-confirmed cases and 11 deaths statewide, and in addition to getting your flu shot, DPH recommends everyday measures that people can take to prevent the spread of all infections, which would also slow the spread of coronavirus disease:               Cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. If you use a tissue, dispose of it right away.Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, including the backs of your hands and under your nails, for 20 seconds. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Do not touch your face, eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.Clean commonly used surfaces such as computers, desktops, countertops cabinets, handles and more with disinfectant.Stay home when you are sick.If you are healthy, the CDC does not recommend buying or using face masks. You should only wear a mask if a health care provider tells you do so.          Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. Reported illnesses have ranged from people with little to no symptoms (similar to the common cold) to people being severely ill and dying.

In addition to updates on the global coronavirus disease outbreak, the website also contains tips for Delawareans, and the number of returning travelers that DPH is currently monitoring, which is updated regularly.

There is one additional PUI whose test results are currently pending.       DPH also issued updated guidance for monitoring returning travelers as new countries have been added to the list of countries with coronavirus disease-related travel alerts.  Any travelers returning from a country with a Level 2 or higher Travel Alert - China, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Japan - in the last 14 days and who:          Have fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, should contact DPH at 1-866-408-1899 to discuss next steps.

Asymptomatic returning travelers are asked to stay home (no work, school, attending public gatherings) during this 14-day period. If a returning traveler develops symptoms during this time, and there is no medical emergency, they should contact DPH instead of calling 9-1-1 or visit a walk-in or urgent-care facility.                DPH is focusing its outreach efforts in the coming week to the business community, who are encouraged to review flexible leave policies and consider options for employees such as telecommuting both for returning travelers from Level 2 or higher countries, and in the event of community spread of coronavirus disease.             DPH continues to recommend simple, everyday measures that people can take to prevent the spread of all infections. CDC's Dr. Nancy Messenier said in a briefing Tuesday, that the other side of stopping the spread of coronavirus disease is not catching it.  These preventive measures are:           Cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. If you use a tissue, dispose of it right away.      Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, including the backs of your hands and under your nails.     Clean surfaces at home, work or school that you use often.     Stay home when you are sick.

"DPH INVESTIGATING MUMPS OUTBREAK AMONG SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN IN NEW CASTLE COUNTY ","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","March 4, 2020","DOVER (March 4, 2020) - The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is investigating an outbreak of mumps cases among school-age children in New Castle County. As of March 3, 2020, DPH had identified nine cases of mumps as part of this outbreak, including seven confirmed cases and two probable cases. The confirmed cases involve five individuals at William Penn High School, one individual at George Read Middle School, both within the Colonial School District; and one individual at St. Georges Technical High School within the New Castle County Vo-Tech School District. No additional information about those individuals will be provided to protect personal health information.            DPH has been coordinating closely with the impacted schools and school districts since cases were first identified to provide guidance for limiting the spread of illness and to identify any other potential cases. The schools notified their communities of the positive cases and potential exposure to mumps, and provided recommended guidance to families.           DPH advises any student or any member of the household who has symptoms or develops symptoms should be kept at home. In addition, it is recommended that parents of children who may have been exposed to mumps contact their child's primary care provider. Children with suspected or confirmed mumps should stay home for five days after the onset of parotitis (gland swelling), or as directed by their primary care provider.             Mumps is an acute viral infection spread through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, or talking, sharing items, such as cups or eating utensils, with others, and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that a substantial increase in the number of mumps outbreaks and outbreak-associated cases have occurred in the United States since late 2015.           The symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, body aches, loss of appetite and swelling of parotid salivary gland(s) - glands on the insides of the cheeks, floor of the mouth, and under the tongue.  Mumps symptoms could develop from 12 days to 25 days after exposure. As an ongoing preventive measure, it is recommended that individuals follow good hand washing practices. Parents are encouraged to review the immunization records for their children and make sure they are up to date on recommended vaccines, including the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, and to contact their child's primary care provider with any questions.             Some people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and often they do not know they have the disease. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults. Complications can include:                inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) in males who have reached puberty; rarely does this lead to fertility problems     inflammation of the brain (encephalitis)     inflammation of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)     inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis) and/or breast tissue (mastitis)     deafness                The CDC recommends children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Teens and adults who did not get the recommended MMR vaccines per the above schedule should be vaccinated so they are up to date.           It is possible for someone to get the mumps even after they have been vaccinated, however, that is not to say the mumps vaccine is ineffective. MMR vaccine is safe and effective. A person with two doses of MMR vaccine has about an 88% reduction in risk for mumps; a person with one dose has a 78% reduction in risk for mumps. In addition, disease symptoms are milder and complications are less frequent in vaccinated people. Also, high vaccination coverage helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks, therefore it is still very important to be up to date on MMR vaccine.     Individuals with questions should contact their primary care provider or the Division of Public Health at 1-888-295-5156.            Mumps is a reportable disease in Delaware. Health care providers should promptly report suspected cases of mumps, and confirmed cases, to the DPH Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology (OIDE) at 302-744-4990 (normal business hours) or 1-888-295-5156 (outside of normal business hours), fax to 302-223-1540, or email reportdisease@delaware.gov.

Those who need to call 9-1-1 for a medical emergency should advise dispatchers of their recent travel and symptoms;     Do not have fever, cough and/or shortness of breath (asymptomatic travelers), should contact DPH at 1-888-295-5156 for instructions on self-monitoring.     Asymptomatic returning travelers are asked to stay home (no work, school, attending public gatherings) during this 14-day period. If a returning traveler develops symptoms during this time, and there is no medical emergency, they should contact DPH instead of calling 9-1-1 or visiting a walk-in or urgent care facility.       Guidance on monitoring of returning travelers and other information about coronavirus disease is changing rapidly and frequently. Travelers are encouraged to follow the latest guidance on de.gov/coronavirus.       DPH recommends everyday measures that people can take to prevent the spread of all infections, which would also slow the spread of coronavirus disease:           Cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand. If you use a tissue, dispose of it right away.      Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, including the backs of your hands and under your nails.     Clean surfaces at home, work or school that you use often.     Stay home when you are sick.     If you are healthy, the CDC does not recommend buying or using face masks. If you are infected, however, a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus.          Both CDC and DPH continue to state that the risk of COVID-19 spreading to the general public remains low. While the number of cases are increasing in the U.S., there is no community spread of the virus in Delaware.     DPH will continue to update the public as more information becomes available.

"DIVISION OF PUBLIC HEALTH ANNOUNCES THAT 2 PATIENTS IN KENT COUNTY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR CORONAVIRUS DISEASE","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","March 2, 2020","STANTON (March 2, 2020)  - Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) Director Dr. Karyl Rattay announced at a press conference today that DPH has two Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for coronavirus disease in Kent County, who had traveled to a country under a travel alert. Three previous PUIs were tested and all came back negative.      As Delaware continues to prepare for community spread of the virus, Dr. Rattay also announced that the Division of Public Health Lab in Smyrna now has the capability to test for coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. The tests for the two patients in Kent County will be the first run at the lab. To date, no one in Delaware has tested positive for COVID-19.       Dr. Rattay said the DPH Lab will have the ability to turn around tests in approximately a day for COVID-19 and provide either a presumptive positive or negative result. The CDC will provide confirmatory testing.       ""Despite the increased number of cases of COVID-19 in the United States, the immediate health risk to Delawareans and most Americans remains low,"" Dr. Rattay said at the press conference at ChristianaCare's John H. Ammon Medical Educational Center at Christiana Hospital. ""We are grateful now to have the ability to test for the virus at our lab and will announce the results of the two patients in Kent County as soon as we can. Going forward, we will continue to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance and work with our health care partners to determine when it is appropriate to test patients for coronavirus disease.""     Dr. Rattay also announced that the Division of Public Health will open a call center to field inquiries from the public by mid-week. The phone number will be announced when the call center is ready. DPH is also issuing updated guidance for monitoring returning travelers as new countries have been added to the list of countries with coronavirus disease-related travel alerts.  Any travelers returning from a country with a Level 2 or higher Travel Alert in the last 14 days and who:               Have fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, should contact DPH at 1-888-295-5156 to discuss next steps.

""Today, there are important things that Delawareans can do to stay healthy, to reduce the burden on the health care system, and to prepare if community transmission of coronavirus disease does happen in our state,"" said Department of Health of Social Services (DHSS) Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. In addition to guidance for individuals, she also encouraged Delaware employers to review their plans to operate with adaptations such as telework and flexible sick leave policies, as well as how to respond if an employee does get sick.      ""Most importantly, in the event of an outbreak locally, we will need employers to stress to employees that they not to come work when they are sick,"" Secretary Walker said.      As of March 2, there are more than 89,000 cases of coronavirus disease worldwide, including more than 3,000 deaths. There are 43 cases and two deaths to date in the United States. Consistent with the CDC's guidance, Dr. Rattay said community spread is likely to increase in the United States. ""Our efforts, where before they were focused on containment of the disease, are now focused on mitigating the impact of it when it does occur.""               CDC officials also have said it is important for families and communities to prepare for what they would do if community spread occurs by recommending:          Schools review their infection prevention and control plans in the event there is a local outbreak.     Employers review their contingency plans to ensure they are able to operate with adaptations and respond if an employee gets sick.     Individuals and families understand steps they can take to help slow the spread of illness, including avoiding travel to hard-hit areas and staying home when sick.      To date, Delaware:          Has activated the Division of Public Health's State Health Operations Center to allow for enhanced response coordination;     Maintains communication and outreach with federal, state and local partners;     Is monitoring asymptomatic (not sick) individuals returning from Mainland China to ensure they do not develop symptoms;     Provides symptom monitoring guidance for residents returning to Delaware from China, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Iran;     Participates in frequent calls with health care systems, EMS and first responder agencies and other state agency partners;     Provides information to health care professionals, businesses and educational settings; and      Has reviewed and adapted current pandemic flu plans for COVID-19               DPH has a strong relationship with hospitals, EMS, and first responder agencies through its partnership with the state's Department of Safety and Homeland Security (DSHS). Staff have been holding regular calls with hospitals, the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), DSHS and EMS agencies.      Delaware is experiencing a particularly serious flu season with more than 5,500 lab-confirmed cases and 11 deaths statewide, and in addition to getting your flu shot, DPH recommends everyday measures that people can take to prevent the spread of all infections, which would also slow the spread of coronavirus disease:           Cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand.

To date, no one in Delaware has tested positive for COVID-19.          ""While the CDC's comments this week indicate heightened concern, it is important to note that we have been making preparations all along to not only contain the spread of the disease, should it occur in Delaware, but also to mitigate the impact of the virus if community spread were to occur,"" said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. ""As we continue to prepare for the likelihood of community spread in the U.S., we have begun stepping up our planning and preparedness efforts around mitigation strategies recommended by the CDC. In the coming days and weeks we will be having additional conversations with health care providers, schools, businesses and other state partners and stakeholders about what guidance to consider in the event of an outbreak locally.""          As of February 25, there are more than 80,000 cases of coronavirus disease worldwide, including more than 2,700 deaths. There are 57 cases and no deaths to date in the United States. The CDC expects cases to continue to be confirmed in the upcoming days and weeks, but wants everyone to take action to help prevent the spread of the virus. There is currently no community spread of the disease in the U.S., including Delaware. CDC officials also said due to the rapidly changing nature of the spread of COVID-19 around the world, it is important for families to be prepared.           CDC is recommending communities prepare for what they would do if community spread occurs by:                Recommending schools review their infection prevention and control plans in the event there is a local outbreak in the community.     Recommending employers in the public and private sectors review their plans to ensure they are able to operate with adaptations like telework and flexible sick leave policies, as well as how to respond if an employee gets sick.     Providing guidance to the public about the steps they can take that would help slow the spread of illness, including staying home when sick.

Delaware is experiencing a particularly serious flu season with over 5,000 cases and 11 deaths statewide, and DPH continues to recommend everyday measures that people can take to prevent the spread of all germs - which would also slow the spread of coronavirus disease: cover coughs and sneezes, stay home when sick, wash your hands frequently, and clean frequently touched surfaces often. While there is no vaccine yet against coronavirus, there is one to protect against influenza, and we still recommend getting it if you have not done so.      Symptoms of the COVID-19 in people who have been exposed can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure.

"DPH ANNOUNCES ADDITIONAL FLU-RELATED DEATHS, PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO AVOID ILLNESS","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","February 21, 2020","DOVER (Feb. 21, 2020) - The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) continues to urge individuals to take steps to prevent the flu as the number of confirmed flu cases continues to increase, and health officials announce additional flu-related deaths for the 2019-2020 season. To date, nine Delawareans have passed away due to flu-related complications during the 2019-2020 flu season. All nine individuals had underlying medical conditions.          Most recently, an 83-year-old woman from New Castle County who was diagnosed with influenza A passed away this week due to complications from the flu. Last week, a 59-year-old woman from New Castle County who was also diagnosed with influenza A passed away due to flu complications. Of the nine individuals who have passed away this season, they range in age from 29 to 96. Five persons were from New Castle County, one was from Kent County and three were from Sussex County. Six individuals were diagnosed with Influenza A and three were diagnosed with Influenza B. Two of the nine individuals who died from flu complications received the flu vaccine this season.          As of February 15, 2020, there have been 5,047 confirmed cases of influenza in Delaware, including 267 hospitalizations. These numbers reflect only the number of lab-confirmed cases; the actual number of cases circulating statewide is likely much higher. By comparison, at the same time in the 2018-2019 season, there were 3,264 flu cases in Delaware, including 537 hospitalizations, and 13 flu-related deaths.     ""We express our deepest condolences to the family and friends of those we have lost due to the flu,"" said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. ""It's not too late to get the flu vaccine. People six months and older should receive the flu vaccine every year. The vaccine's main purpose is to make you less likely to catch the flu, but if you still catch it, the vaccine will make your symptoms milder. It takes two weeks for the antibodies in the flu vaccine to become fully effective, so if you haven't gotten the vaccine yet, you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. Always remember to take any antiviral medicine that your doctor prescribes as needed, also.""     In addition to getting a flu vaccine and taking antiviral medication, DPH recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:                Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.     Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.     Avoid close contact with people who are sick.     Stay home when you are sick.     Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If no tissue is available, cough or sneeze into your inner elbow.     Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.     Over-the-counter medicines can provide symptom relief, but if you suspect you have influenza, call your doctor as he or she may decide to provide antiviral medications to help hasten recovery and prevent serious complications. This is particularly important for those who feel very sick, are pregnant or have chronic medical conditions.     The risk for flu-related deaths is greatly increased in the very young, older individuals, and those of any age who have underlying health conditions. DPH continues to remind the public that there are steps they can take to prevent the spread of the flu. It is important for older individuals with underlying health conditions not only to be vaccinated, but also to limit contact with anyone who may be sick with influenza, and to contact their health care provider as soon as they become ill. Also, family, friends, and caregivers of older individuals with underlying health conditions should be vaccinated and arrange for alternative care, if possible, if they become sick with influenza.     DPH also recommends that individuals with chronic diseases monitor and manage their conditions, as non-compliance with physician's recommendations can increase the risk for infection and complications. This includes maintaining appointments with their health care provider, taking medications as prescribed, and following diet and exercise recommendations from their doctor. Additionally, individuals who smoke and who are ready to stop using tobacco are encouraged to call the Delaware Quitline at 1-866-409-1858.     Flu symptoms come on suddenly, and include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headaches and body aches, chills and fatigue. Some people get complications including pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinus and ear infections. People with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes and asthma are more susceptible to catching the flu.     Flu vaccines are available at many pharmacies and grocery stores, and through primary care physicians and some specialists. To find participating stores, enter your ZIP code in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flu vaccine finder at www.cdc.gov/flu/.

"DPH ANNOUNCES THIRD NEGATIVE TEST RESULT FOR CORONAVIRUS","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","February 15, 2020","DOVER (February 15, 2020) - The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is announcing that the second of two pending test results for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has come back negative. The individual, a New Castle County resident, is no longer hospitalized and is continuing to recover from their underlying illness at home. DPH will not be providing any additional information about the individual. Three Delawareans have been tested for COVID-19 to date, and all three results have been negative. There are no other persons under investigation in Delaware at this time.           In addition, DPH continues to monitor 27 asymptomatic travelers (travelers who are not sick with fever/cough/shortness of breath) arriving in the U.S. from mainland China after Feb. 3. The CDC recommended that such travelers be monitored for 14 days after their return. During the 14 days after their return from China, these persons are being asked to remain at home while self-monitoring for symptoms. If any of these persons shows symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, they should call DPH right away to determine next steps, which may include transport to a local hospital for evaluation, isolation and testing.           DPH is emphasizing that these individuals are not sick, and exhibit no symptoms consistent with coronavirus. Individuals being monitored for symptoms are NOT considered Patients Under Investigation (PUI), which are those individuals who meet criteria for testing based on symptoms and travel history. DPH began reporting the number of returning travelers being monitored, as well as PUIs, on its website https://dhss.delaware.gov/dph on Monday, Feb. 10. Numbers will be updated every Tuesday and Friday afterward.          Individuals who traveled from China prior to Feb. 3, 2020, are asked to self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after their return. If they become ill within 14 days of their return, they should avoid contact with others, and call ahead to their health care provider to discuss their recent travel, symptoms, and next steps. The health care provider should in turn contact DPH to coordinate next steps. Individuals who returned from China prior to Feb. 3, 2020, do not need to be excluded from school or work. DPH continues to encourage employers and administrators to review their own health policies to make decisions regarding exclusion from work/school for these individuals.           Both CDC and DPH continue to state that the risk of COVID-19 spreading to the general public remains low. While the number of cases are increasing in the U.S., there is no spread of the virus in the community. Risk is based on exposure. Only those individuals with recent travel to China or who have had contact with someone who has had recent travel and is ill, have an increased risk of becoming ill. For persons without an associated travel risk, it should be assumed that most respiratory illnesses are not COVID-19. As of Feb. 3, 2020, all persons returning from Hubei Province in China, as well as symptomatic persons returning from mainland China, will be quarantined for 14 days near a United States airport of entry, per federal orders.           DPH officials are also emphasizing that Asian American/Pacific Islander individuals are at no higher risk of carrying COVID-19 than any other individual. DPH urges people not to make assumptions that someone might be ill or could become ill based on their accent, background or skin color.           DPH will continue to update the public as more information becomes available. For more information on COVID-19, visit  https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph.

"DPH ANNOUNCES SECOND NEGATIVE TEST RESULT FOR CORONAVIRUS","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","February 13, 2020","DOVER (February 13, 2020) - The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is announcing that one of two pending test results for 2019 novel coronavirus (now known as COVID-19) has come back negative. The individual has been discharged from the hospital and is continuing to recover from their underlying illness at home. Test results for one other person are still pending from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are expected in the coming days. The individual, a New Castle County resident, remains hospitalized until test results are returned. No additional information is being provided about either individual.          In addition, DPH continues to monitor 13 asymptomatic travelers (travelers who are not sick with fever/cough/shortness of breath) arriving in the U.S. from mainland China after Feb. 3. The CDC recommended that such travelers be monitored for 14 days after their return. During the 14 days after their return from China, these persons are being asked to remain at home while self-monitoring for symptoms. If any of these persons shows symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, they should call DPH right away to determine next steps, which may include transport to a local hospital for evaluation, isolation and testing.          DPH is emphasizing that these individuals are not sick, and exhibit no symptoms consistent with coronavirus. Individuals being monitored for symptoms are NOT considered Patients Under Investigation (PUI), which are those individuals who meet criteria for testing based on symptoms and travel history. DPH began reporting the number of returning travelers being monitored, as well as PUIs, on its website https://dhss.delaware.gov/dph on Monday, Feb. 10. Numbers will be updated every Tuesday and Friday afterward.          Individuals who traveled from China prior to Feb. 3, 2020, are asked to self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after their return. If they become ill within 14 days of their return, they should avoid contact with others, and call ahead to their health care provider to discuss their recent travel, symptoms, and next steps. The health care provider should in turn contact DPH to coordinate next steps. Individuals who returned from China prior to Feb. 3, 2020, do not need to be excluded from school or work. DPH continues to encourage employers and administrators to review their own health policies to make decisions regarding exclusion from work/school for these individuals.          Both CDC and DPH continue to state that the risk of COVID-19 spreading to the general public remains low. While the number of cases are increasing in the U.S., there is no spread of the virus in the community. Risk is based on exposure. Only those individuals with recent travel to China or who have had contact with someone who has had recent travel and is ill, have an increased risk of becoming ill. For persons without an associated travel risk, it should be assumed that most respiratory illnesses are not COVID-19. As of Feb. 3, 2020, all persons returning from Hubei Province in China, as well as symptomatic persons returning from mainland China, will be quarantined for 14 days near a United States airport of entry, per federal orders.          DPH officials are also emphasizing that Asian American/Pacific Islander individuals are at no higher risk of carrying the 2019 novel coronavirus than any other individual. DPH urges people not to make assumptions that someone might be ill or could become ill based on their accent, background or skin color.     Most Delawareans are at greater risk of contracting seasonal influenza than coronavirus. COVID-19 has not been found to be spreading widely in the U.S., so there are no additional precautions recommended for the general public. The best guidance is to take the same everyday precautions recommended for avoiding colds and flu:          Get your flu vaccine if you have not already.     Stay home when you are sick and avoid well people as much as possible.     Cover your coughs and sneezes.     Practice good hand hygiene - frequently wash hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.          A person who is deaf, hard-of-hearing, deaf-blind or speech-disabled can call the DPH phone number above by using TTY services. Dial 7-1-1 or 800-232-5460 to type your conversation to a relay operator, who reads your conversation to a hearing person at DPH.

DPH continues to coordinate closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health care providers to identify potential cases, and has updated its guidance for risk assessment and monitoring travelers returning from China.           ""While there are currently no cases of 2019-nCoV in Delaware and the risk of this novel coronavirus spreading to the general public remains low, DPH is working to implement appropriate monitoring protocols and disease prevention strategies to further reduce any chance of transmission,"" said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. ""These protocols are based on not only our past experience with monitoring returning travelers during the Ebola outbreak, but also on CDC guidance and evolving knowledge about this virus.""          Risk is based on exposure. Only those individuals with recent travel to China or those who had contact with someone who recently traveled and is ill have an increased risk of becoming ill.

All asymptomatic travelers (travelers who are not sick with fever/cough/shortness of breath) arriving from mainland China outside of Hubei Province will be monitored by DPH for symptoms for 14 days after their return. During that time, DPH (or its designee) will be in daily contact with those persons to check their status and health. Individuals will be asked to stay at home during this period while self-monitoring for symptoms. If any of these persons shows symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, they should call DPH right away to determine next steps, which may include transport to a local hospital for evaluation, isolation and testing.

""You are much more likely to become sick with a common cold virus or flu than to be diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus"", said Dr. Rattay. ""Since the start of the flu season, there have been nearly 3,000 diagnosed cases of flu and we just learned of the seventh flu death this season in Delaware. Our Delaware residents of Chinese descent are important members of our community and are not at an increased risk for spreading the coronavirus.""           Symptoms of 2019-nCoV are most similar to lower respiratory infections with patients having fever, cough and shortness of breath. There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. Many individuals infected with 2019-nCoV recover with rest, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking over-the-counter medications to help relieve symptoms.          If at any point laboratory testing confirms a case of 2019-nCoV in a Delaware resident, the available details and protective recommendations would be shared with both the affected parties and the public as quickly as possible.

The U.S. Department of State issued a travel advisory on January 31, 2020, advising U.S. citizens not to travel to China due to the ongoing situation involving 2019-nCoV. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice, and commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China. If you are considering a trip to China, keep an eye on the news, federal travel advisories, and be aware of this evolving situation.

"DIVISION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE PUBLISH SECOND EDITION OF HEALTH EQUITY GUIDE ","DPH, Delaware, health, social services, dhss, press release","The State of Delaware","DHSS Press Release  - Delaware Health and Social Services - State of Delaware","February 4, 2020","DOVER (Feb. 4, 2020) - The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH), along with the University of Delaware, has released the second edition of the Health Equity Guide for Public Health Practitioners and Partners. The latest edition, which follows the 2015 release of the original guide, further supports the state's efforts to advance health equity in Delaware.        The Health Equity Guide highlights the best available evidence and data to explain the connections between the social determinants of health and good overall health. Social determinants of health are the 90 percent of what affects a patient's health that have nothing to do with clinical care, such as housing, transportation, employment, public safety, income, or how close they live to a grocery store, park or health care provider. The second edition of the guide also focuses on structural racism as a fundamental cause of health inequities.                   ""Everyone - regardless of race, religion, political belief, ability, sexual orientation and economic or social condition - has the right to a standard of living adequate for optimal health,"" said DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay. ""By advancing health equity, we provide every Delawarean with equal opportunities to achieve their full health potential.""              For example, there is strong evidence tying the stability, quality, safety, and affordability of housing to health outcomes. Throughout Delaware, there is a shortage of affordable rental homes that are available to extremely low-income households, whose incomes are at or below the poverty guideline or 30 percent of their area median income (AMI).               ""Many of these households are severely cost burdened because they must spend more than half of their income on housing,"" said DHSS Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, a practicing family physician. ""Severely cost-burdened households are more likely than other renters to sacrifice such necessities as health care and healthy food to pay the rent. Plus, they're more likely to experience unstable housing situations like evictions.""              To improve environmental and social conditions, all sectors - public health, health care systems, businesses, schools, religious organizations, lawmakers, community leaders, non-profit organizations, and other stakeholders - must join together to address inequities tied to social determinants, and in doing so will help to advance overall health.              ""As our understanding of what is needed for optimal health changes, so should our approach,"" said Rita Landgraf, director of the UD Partnership for Healthy Communities. ""Addressing equity is key, and this guide should be required reading for anyone working to improve the health of Delawareans.""              DPH believes that all practitioners working in any field of study can find value in reading the second edition of the Health Equity Guide. The latest edition includes the most current data regarding health status and inequities that currently exist in Delaware, and shares new strategies and tools to support practitioners and partners in the implementation of evidenced-based strategies, interventions and policy considerations.              Both versions of the guide highlight place-based, system, environmental, and policy-oriented strategies, as well as research, evaluation, and leadership.              ""Unless we are purposeful in addressing our persistent health inequities, it will be difficult for us to collectively achieve our goals to create a healthier Delaware."" said DPH Associate Deputy Director Cassandra Codes-Johnson, who co-authored the first and second editions with Erin K. Knight, associate director of the UD Partnership for Healthy Communities and associate director of the Biden School's Center for Community Research & Service. In November 2019, the pair presented the publication at the American Public Health Association's Annual Meeting and Expo held in Philadelphia.       ""The Division of Public Health should be commended for continuing to promote and invest in strategies that advance health equity,"" said Erin K. Knight. ""Addressing racism and other social inequities that lead to poor health requires courage and persistence, and I'm grateful that we have such committed leaders in our state.""
